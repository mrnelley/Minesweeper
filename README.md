MVP:
Mines are randomly placed at the beginning of the game and remain in their locations during the game.
The game supports I/O - it accepts a tile to reveal and provides feedback about the contents of the tile.
Revealed tiles correctly indicate one of the 3 states above (Danger, Caution, Safe).

Stretch: 
Allow the player to specify the mine field dimensions - number of columns and rows.
End the game when a mine tile is selected.
Include a timer that forces the player to make a selection within a pre-determined number of seconds.
A Caution Tile also includes the number of adjacent mines - e.g. 1 if only 1 mine is in immediate proximity
Two-player support with turns. The last player standing wins or the game is tied.
Save game state and continue later.
Any other fun extensions to the original problem. Show your creativity!
